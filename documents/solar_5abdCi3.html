    <h1>Facts About the Sun</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type of Star:</strong> The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), also known as a yellow dwarf.</li>
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of other elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sun's core temperature reaches about <strong>15 million°C (27 million°F)</strong>.</li>
                <li>The surface temperature (photosphere) is approximately <strong>5,500°C (9,932°F)</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Size and Mass:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sun's diameter is about <strong>1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles)</strong>.</li>
                <li>It contains <strong>99.86% of the total mass</strong> of the solar system.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Energy Production:</strong> The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core.</li>
        <li><strong>Light Travel Time:</strong> Light from the Sun takes approximately <strong>8 minutes and 20 seconds</strong> to reach Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> The Sun is estimated to be <strong>4.6 billion years old</strong> and is halfway through its life cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> The Sun rotates on its axis approximately once every <strong>25 days</strong> at the equator and once every <strong>36 days</strong> at the poles (differential rotation).</li>
        <li><strong>Solar Activity:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sun has an <strong>11-year solar cycle</strong>, marked by varying levels of solar activity like sunspots and solar flares.</li>
                <li>Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can affect Earth's magnetosphere, causing geomagnetic storms.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Role in the Solar System:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sun’s gravity holds the solar system together.</li>
                <li>It provides the energy necessary for life on Earth through sunlight.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
