Goldfish is a seriously good topping for chili. 
This was a revelation for me. I learned it when my daughter was born and my wife was still recovering. Someone dropped off like–I kid you not–three gallons of homemade chili. We were grateful to have something we could microwave for hearty sustenance in the January cold but I was looking for ways to mix it up.

So, chili is delicious but even better with toppings. Crackers are good but bland. Cheese is good but can sometimes just add to the goo. Goldfish are the best of both worlds, and you don’t have to crush them in your hand like a cracker.

Crackers are good for the crunch. Cheese is good for the flavor. You get the best of both worlds if you’re not afraid to look a little silly and think outside the box. This is a good metaphor for a lot of things. So go ahead. Just grab them out of the box and toss them into the bowl and–voila. Don’t mix them in, just throw them on top and eat them and throw the next layer on top as you go. Just try it, trust me.
